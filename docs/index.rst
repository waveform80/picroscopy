Documentation for picroscopy
============================

Picroscopy is a small Python web-application which is intended for usage with a
`Raspberry Pi`_ as a microscopy solution. With the `Raspberry Pi Camera`_
mounted on a microscope, the Raspberry Pi provides a live video feed to its
monitor via HDMI, while another machine can be used to control the setup via a
web-based interface.

The project is written in `Python`_ 3 and is open-sourced under the `GPL
license`_. Packages can be downloaded from the project `homepage`_. The `source
code`_ can be obtained from GitHub. The `documentation`_ can be read on
ReadTheDocs.
